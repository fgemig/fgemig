### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio Gemignani, and i am from Brazil.

I work as a back-end developer since 2011 where most of the time, with Microsoft technologies. In the last few years I have been studying frond-end and mobile, which are areas that I like a lot.

I believe in technology as a transformation tool, supporting the human being in building solutions to the problems of humanity.

More about me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently work as a developer in a port company;
- âš¡ I have skills in Full Stack development, where I always try to follow the best practices, test-oriented development and clean code;
- ðŸŽµ In my spare time, I like to play the bass and listen to music;
